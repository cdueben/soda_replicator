`.Rprofile`, `code.Rproj`, `renv.lock`, the `renv` directory, and this readme serve as illustrative examples only. Delete them at the beginning of your project.

You do not need to have a `main.do`, `main.R`, or `main.py` file from the start of your project. Feel free to create it at a later stage.
